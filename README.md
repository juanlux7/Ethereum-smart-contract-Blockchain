# Ethereum-smart-contract-Blockchain Dapp
A Decentralized Application with Solidity, Javascript and ReactJS. This is a simple lottery game with a couple of interesting functions,
testing part with Mocha framework.

## In this project, I create a Dapp with Solidity and React in order to play with Smart contracts and Ethereum.

Versions used in this project:

  - Solidity Compiler (solc): 0.4.25
  - React 16
  - Mocha test 6
  
 
 I had to use Solidity compiler 0.4.25 instead of ^0.5.0 because there were many breaking changes between versions and it is
 really hard to adapt versions.
